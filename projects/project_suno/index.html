  <p>I heard about this AI tool that could help create music. I also think that the content creator ThePrimeagen used music created using the tool in his streams to avoid playing copyrighted music. I tried the free tier for a bit to get a hang of how to use the tool. I made a few songs and decided I would try out the paid tier for a month.<br><br>It took a few more songs to try out the new features included in the paid tier.</p>
